			<h3>If you also feel a mixture of anger, disappointment and resentment from the recent election, here are some tips shared by a Brexit survivor that might be able to help you. </h3>

			<article>
				<h1> <li> UNPLUG AND GO TO BED</li> </h1>
				<p align="justify">You may think staying up all night flicking between CNN, MSNBC, BBC (to see how the world is coping with this news) and FOX (know thy enemy am I right?) but chances are you'll wake up feeling politically hungover and tired. Unplug. Go to bed. Cry in your pillowcase. And if need be, turn on some NPR when you wake up in the morning. </p>

				<h1> <li> PUT DOWN THE EZEKIEL BREAD AND EAT</li> </h1>
				<p align="justify">Paleo diet be damned. This is the time for you to eat whatever makes you happy. So now is the time to lean in. Lean in to your mom's lasagna, your partner's french toast or that perfect slice from Joe's down the road. Helpful rule of thumb, calories do not count on election day AND post-election when you are feeling anxious AF.</p>

				<h1> <li> STEP AWAY FROM YOUR COMPUTER AND GO FOR A WALK</li> </h1>
				<p align="justify">I'm sure you already know, but here's a refresher on the benefits of going for a walk, you know outside (please note that pacing around your livingroom does not count): </p>

				<ul>
					<li>Helps maintain a healthy weight;</li>
					<li>Help prevent or manage various conditions, including heart disease, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes;</li>
					<li>Strengthens bones and muscles;</li>
					<li>Improves (post-election) anxiety, disappointment and resentment; and</li>
					<li>Will inevitably lead you to fellow post-election anxiety sufferers (there's no point in being a hero and going at it alone):</li>

				<h1> <li> BAKE YOURSELF HAPPY</li> </h1>
				<p align="justify">Yes, food really is a miracle cure in my books. This time you aren't stuffing yourself with something tasty, you are going to bake something for someone you love. Just try it. I dare ya. Don't believe me? Mental health experts have come round to the idea that baking could very well be helpful in relieving the symptoms of anxiety and depression by combining the physical and projection aspects of the traditional occupational therapies. Kneading a batch of bread dough, weighing your ingredients and slowly folding in your dry ingredients alone will help you feel more in control of the world around you. Something about the repetitive motions will help you feel calm and in control. The best part? You can share this feeling with someone who understands what you're going through. </p>

				<h1> <li> GET TO WORK</li> </h1>
				<p align="justify">We still (for now at least) live in a democracy, and there is work to be done. Trust me, I went through Brexit. Fundraise/donate to organizations that reflect your values like Planned Parenthood and the ACLU. Take action with local advocacy groups. I'll plug the one I respect the most, RESULTS, which has global and domestic advocacy groups all over the country (and affiliates all over the world!) organizing around key moments and important legislation on poverty. But there are others - large global campaigns, local food banks, harm reduction groups, refugee resettlement groups, the list goes on. I'm exploring too, and am happy navigate opportunities together. The important thing to remember is that the fight isn't over, we're just getting started. </p>
